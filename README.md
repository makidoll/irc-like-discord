# IRC-like Discord
> ðŸ’¬ Removes features from Discord to make people worry less.

Possible thanks to: https://github.com/leovoel/BeautifulDiscord

If you have a better name for this repo, feel free to tell me...

## What is this?

This will remove certain features from Discord such as:

- `...is typing`
- `is playing...`
- Player statuses

It makes Discord friends feel like they're on IRC bouncers.

## Why...?

All of those things have eaten my attention span and now I'm left with checking Discord constantly feeling worried. I'm a very emotional person and I can care about people more than myself, which is inherently bad anyway. Now I often deal with many headaches, a lot of anxiety and panic attacks. I have considered to stop using Discord for a while but I would miss my friends and I'm only gonna hurt myself more by doing that. If this all seems silly to you... just leave...
