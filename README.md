# Forceful Unworry (Discord)
> ðŸ˜” Discord continuously makes me worried, nervous and has ruined my attention span.

## What is this?

This will remove certain features from Discord such as:

- `...is typing`
- `is playing...`
- Player status

## Why...?

All of those things have eaten my attention span and now I'm left with checking Discord constantly feeling worried. I'm a very emotional person and I can care about people more than myself, which is inherently bad anyway. Now I often deal with many headaches, a lot of anxiety and panic attacks. I have considered to stop using Discord for a while but I would miss my friends and I'm only gonna hurt myself more by doing that. If this all seems silly to you... just leave...
